1. Understand the goal
2. Plan your board 
3. Buy the right size board
		 three-panel display board that unfolds to be 36" tall by 48
4. Choose a great title
		spend time brainstorming for the best title for your project. Come up with a list of possible titles before you decide.
5. Know your font sizes
		Use a font size of at least 16 points for your main body text. Anything smaller is too hard to read. (See the following tables for more information on text size.)
- Stick with traditional fonts like Arial, Times New Roman, or similar typefaces.
- Use italics or bold for emphasis, not for all your text.
- Don't place your text on top of a picture; that makes it difficult to read.
- Don't use ALL CAPS; THEY ARE MUCH HARDER TO READ.
- Don't use reverse type (white text on a dark background).
- It is hard to read. Use black characters on a white (or pastel) background.
- The words 'Do not use artistic font' are typed in a script font. They are much harder to read.
- Don't use more than two or three different fonts on your board. Times New Roman for body copy and Arial for headings makes for a nice combination.
6. Pictures can be powerful
7. Show your data
8. Make a list of elements you need to type up or photos you need to print out
 		Check things off your list after you print them to help you stay organized and to make sure you don't forget anything. Be sure not to leave out the acknowledgements and bibliography	
9. Use quality materials
		you will need adhesive and may also want to buy stick-on letters, stencils, heavy paper or cardstock to mount your sections on, or other materials. 
10. Don't Wait Until the Last Minute

1. Title                              150+             You want your title to visible from across a rom
2. Headings                       32+              Should be easily readable from 5 feet away by someone just walking by.
3. Subheadings                 20+              This text is smaller than headings, but more noticeable than main text size.
4. Main Body Text           16 – 18           This is a comfortable text size for someone who comes closer to read more.
5. Captions                      12 – 16           It's OK to make these a bit smaller than the body text if necessary.
