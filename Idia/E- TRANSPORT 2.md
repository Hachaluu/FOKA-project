# problems
People are having a huge trouble when they go to '' MENEHARYA'' 
- A new system was introduced because the drivers were asking the people to pay above the required amount  so the government decided to introduce a system which consists of  
- [+] First buying tickets 
- [+] The ticket that has been bought will have the number plate of the car that the people should take
- [+] Then people have to find the car that is assigned for them
- [+] Finally they can start their trip
The above system seem to be a head ace to the people instead of solving the problem 

- people are getting exhausted with the system in '' MENEHARYA''
	- People have to wait to buy tickets 
	- they also have to find the number plate of the car that they are going with which is very exhausting 
	- and sometimes people also choose to pay twice the actual fee just to avoid the above things which is illegal  
## To whom we solve the problem?
	- for worker that work out of city 
	- for the people 
	- for the government
### Does it worth solving the problem?
yes it does worth solving the problem
	- the people will no longer be exhausted of waiting
	- it will be easy for the government to control the drivers
	- the people will pay the exact amount 
- [+] special 
-when the people use this app to buy thickets there will be a small amount of money that will be cut from their account ( a very small amount)
				- ex: 10 cents per 10km (which is fair)
## [[solution for E-Transport 2]]

we think that :
					- app
                     - website or
                     - SMS can solve the problem     how?
let us take an app for instance
- [+] how does the app work?
	- the app will allow the people to buy their ticket with out the need of going to  ''MENEHARYA'' they can easily buy their thickets from their home
	- and the app will tell the people at what time they should arrive to ''MENEHARYA'' so that they do not have to go there and wait until the taxi come
	- and they will receive a   QR-code which has the info about their trip ,the people have to show for the worker that is found at the gates of 'MENEHARYA' 
	- and the worker will scan the QR-code and tell them which taxi they should get in
- if they missed their taxi there will be a special case for them
	- their money will be returned partially or 
	- they will get other taxi by paying small bonus
